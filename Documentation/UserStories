When I roll the dice
I want a number between 1 and 6
so I can move my thing-a-ma-bob

My thing-a-ma-bob stands on my coloured square, when another player crash into my thing-a-ma-bob, nothing happens
My thing-a-ma-bob stands on blank square, when another player crash into my thing-a-ma-bob, my thing-a-ma-bob sends to my nest
My thing-a-ma-bob enter goal, I get 1 point, remove my thing-a-ma-bob from the game.
My thing-a-ma-bob go around the board, open the finishline gate, so I can win the game.
If I roll my dice, it show 6, I can throw again.
