When I roll the dice
I want a number between 1 and 6
so I can move my thing-a-ma-bob


When my thing-a-ma-bob stands on my coloured square (a safe zone)
And another player crashes their thing-a-ma-bob into my thing-a-ma-bob
They are allowed to share the space


When my thing-a-ma-bob stands on blank square
Given that another player crashes into my thing-a-ma-bob with theirs
My thing-a-ma-bob gets sent back to my nest


When my thing-a-ma-bob enters the goal
I get 1 point and my thing-a-ma-bob is removed from the game.


When my thing-a-ma-bob has gone all the way around the board
It should go to the final stretch rather than continue around the edge
So that it can enter the goal


Given that it's my turn and I roll the dice
If it shows a 6
I can both make a move and then take another turn.


Given that I have thing-a-ma-bobs left in my nest
And I roll a 6
I can either move a thing-a-ma-bob on the board or take one out of the nest.
