When I roll the dice
I want a number between 1 and 6
so I can move my thing-a-ma-bob


When my thing-a-ma-bob stands on my coloured square (a safe zone)
And another player crashes their thing-a-ma-bob into my thing-a-ma-bob
They are allowed to share the space


When my thing-a-ma-bob stands on blank square
Given that another player crashes into my thing-a-ma-bob with theirs
My thing-a-ma-bob gets sent back to my nest


When my thing-a-ma-bob enters the goal
I get 1 point and my thing-a-ma-bob is removed from the game.


When my thing-a-ma-bob has gone all the way around the board
It should go to the final stretch rather than continue around the edge
So that it can enter the goal


Given that it's my turn and I roll the dice
If it shows a 6
I can both make a move and then take another turn.


Given that I have thing-a-ma-bobs left in my nest
And I roll a 6
I can either move a thing-a-ma-bob on the board or take one out of the nest.


Given that I have several active thing-a-ma-bobs on the board
And I roll the dice
I get to choose which thing-a-ma-bob should move

Given that I have one or more thing-a-ma-bobs on the final stretch before the goal
If I roll a number on the dice that's higher than the number of steps remaining
That thing-a-ma-bob is not allowed to move even if it's the only one left.

Given any active game state
If I press the "save game" button
The game's current state should be saved to the database.

Given that there are saved games in the database
I should be able to select a specific game
And load it's saved state so I can continue playing an earlier game.

Given that I have completed a game
There should be a button called "save replay"
Which stores a replay in the database

Given that there are saved replays in the database
If I pick one of them
I should be able to watch a replay, move-by-move, of an earlier game.
