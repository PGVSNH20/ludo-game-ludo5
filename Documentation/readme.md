Functionality that we want to implement: 
 - A game engine that takes in the player's intended move and updates the game's state based on it.
 - A renderer, either in the console or using a javascript application, that takes the game's state and presents it to players
 - A test project that makes sure all parts of the program functions as intended.
 - A Save/Load function that can take the existing gamestate and save it to a file, or read the file and restore the gamestate.
 - A replay function that stores all moves performed by players so that the game can be watched from start to finish after it's already completed.
